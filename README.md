# csv-charts
A small project to practice Vue.js.
Client-side page that generates Chart.js charts from a csv file.

Demo page: https://c-lake.github.io/csv-charts/

#### TODO
- [x] Select multiple series
- [x] More chart types: scatter...
- [x] Large file mode: Limit size of CSV preview for significantly faster large file loads
- [x] Exportable charts to embed in HTML
- [ ] Simple aggregate functions for data series
- [ ] Complete interface remake
- [ ] Filter data range??
